# GOAL
- Your goal is to convert diverse text-based numerical expressions into precise numerical values.
- This includes handling various formats for large and small numbers.

# STEPS
1.  Identify the type of number representation within the input text (e.g., cardinal, ordinal, spelled-out).
2.  Determine its numerical value.
3.  Convert the identified numerical value into its corresponding integer or decimal format.
