# Slow Burner Super Nurture Campaign
The purpose of this campaign is to build and educate an audience quickly on:

1. Who you are
2. How you can help
3. Why they should trust you
4. Your offer

- The set up consists of recording fifteen 40-60s videos.
- We then run an engagement campaign on Instagram.
- We set it up so that you see the first video and ONLY progress to the second once you have watched at least 50% of the first video.
- As a result we make sure people go through the carefully designed sequence in order.
